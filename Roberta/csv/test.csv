64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"Hi , George . I'm going to have a job interview next week . Could you give me some advice ?"
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"Sure . First of all , it ' s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ' t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic ."
64,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,"Yeah , that's very important ."
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"So you ' d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment ."
64,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,I ' ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer .
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"That ' s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes ."
64,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,It ' s always easier to say something than to do it .
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"It ' s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications ."
64,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans .
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes ."
64,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,It ' s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes .
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous ."
64,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time .
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement .
64,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,It seems that ' clothes make the man ' .
64,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior ."
65,test,work,no_emotion,question,"The boss announces the pay raise today , right ? How much do you think we'll get ?"
65,test,work,no_emotion,inform,No idea . Your guess is as good as mine .
65,test,work,no_emotion,inform,It better be more than last year .
65,test,work,no_emotion,inform,"Well , anything is better than nothing . Wait and see ."
66,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"I'm sorry , our appointment has to be changed ."
66,test,work,no_emotion,inform,What a pity !

142,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"That's why I came to your office today . We think for your model WE - 506 $ 590 would be reasonable , because air conditioners of the same kind sold by other companies are usually about 579-649 ."
142,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"That's true . But if you understand that quality is the most important aspect of a product , you'll agree that 679 is not high , especially when we allow you a 10 % discount ."

553,test,tourism,no_emotion,directive,Good afternoon . I come here specially to pick up my tickets . I booked it last month . This is my reservation note .
553,test,tourism,no_emotion,commissive,"I am terribly sorry . You didn't come to reconfirm recently . You should have come to pick up your ticket three days ago since it's an international flight , any reservation without reconfirmation within 72 hours will be cancelled ."

554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,The last thing to be ignored at a Chinese dinner table is to keep modest .
554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,Does that suggest diners avoid speaking much ? The same is true in the West .
554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"No , absolutely not ! On the contrary , you'll be considered a well-connected , sociable man , if you keep involved in the conversation all the time . But always pay attention to what you say . If the table has a senior guest , say something as upbeat and cheerful as possible . Or maybe , you may give the floor to him and keep listening as if very interested ."
554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,"You mean , keeping a low profile in the presence of the old ? That goes in like with Confucius ' preachings , right ?"
554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Correct . Show respect for the older people . Conventionally , before the meal starts , the younger members are supposed to address each one of the elderly members of the table one by one . Others are kept in waiting until the most venerable guest proclaim the beginning of the meal and takes the first bite . Toasts also go to these men first before people can toast to each other ."
554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,Any other rules to observe in order to keep modest ?
554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Yes , plenty of them . Don't eat fast ! People usually keep their dining pace accorded with others . And all the dishes should not be eaten up completely ."
554,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,Is it because that would give the host the impression that the food was insufficient ?
554,test,ordinary_life,happiness,inform,"Haha , I'm afraid it's simply because no one wishes to be too noticeable by finishing off the plate ."
555,test,work,no_emotion,directive,Our toner cartridges are already out of ink ... Could you make an order for a new set ?
555,test,work,no_emotion,question,"We will need new cartridges for all of the office printers ? That will be a large order , probably about two or three cases . The office supply store we usually go through might not have that many in stock ."
555,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"You can double check with the housekeeping department , but I am pretty sure all of the machines will need new cartridges . Last time when we made our order to the supplier , the quantity was also especially high . They are used to receiving such bulk orders from us . As long as we give them a heads up a couple days in advance , they can usually fill the order ."
555,test,work,no_emotion,question,"OK , I will make a few calls and run our order by housekeeping first to make sure . Is there anything else we need to order while I am at it ?"
555,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"I think the only thing is toner . Try to see if they can deliver it before the end of business day tomorrow . We should really try to do better about waiting until the last minute to fill orders that are usually made on a monthly basis . Anyhow , see what you can do to expedite the order this time ."
555,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,"OK , will do ."

558,test,work,no_emotion,inform,"Sounds practical ! To be honest , sometimes I feel puzzled about my future career . I am not sure if this job suits me the best though I work very hard on it and enjoy being a hard worker . I have always wanted to try something else and learn some new skills ."
558,test,work,no_emotion,inform,"Making a decision to start over is not an easy thing to do . It seems that you need this course more than I do . I love my current job . If I take this course , I hope to learn some tricks to get myself more organized at work . If they can give suggestions about how to boost work relationships , that will be great . I need these to improve my current work performance ."
558,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"Ok , then we can sign up for it together ."
559,test,relationship,no_emotion,question,Who's it knocking at the door ?
559,test,relationship,no_emotion,directive,I think it's the postman . Will you go and open the door ?
559,test,relationship,no_emotion,commissive,All right . I'll get it .
560,test,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,Good evening . Welcome to Cherry's . Do you have a reservation ?

561,test,health,no_emotion,directive,"Hi , I think I was supposed to call for my test results today ."

561,test,health,no_emotion,directive,You can see your results and how they compare to the normal range .
561,test,health,no_emotion,question,How can I see test results from tests I have taken before ?
561,test,health,no_emotion,directive,We put all of your test results up in the same place . Just check the dates for what you need .
562,test,work,no_emotion,inform,"This is our rock-bottom price , Mr . Lee ."
562,test,work,no_emotion,directive,If that's the case . there's not much point in further discussion . We might as well call the whole deal off .
562,test,work,no_emotion,inform,What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too great .
562,test,work,no_emotion,directive,I think it unwise for either of us to be inflexible . How about meeting each other halfway ?
562,test,work,no_emotion,question,What's your proposal ?
562,test,work,no_emotion,directive,"Your unit price is 100 dollars higher than we want . Well , I suggest we meet each other halfway ."
562,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,Do you mean a further reduction of 50 dollars in our price ? That's impossible !
562,test,work,no_emotion,question,What would you suggest ?
562,test,work,no_emotion,directive,The best we can do is another 30 dollars off . That's definitely the lowest we can go .
562,test,work,no_emotion,directive,That still leaves a gap of 20 dollars . Let's meet each other half-away again and split the difference ; I think this is a price we can both be satisfied with .
562,test,work,no_emotion,commissive,OK . We can meet halfway again .

847,test,work,no_emotion,inform,"You know , in a sense , a suits and ties are compulsory for male employees even in July , and no jewelry allowed for most of the female employees . Even the reasonable male leaf is returning the rule , isn ' t that strict ?"
847,test,work,no_emotion,inform,"To some extent , it is . Anyway , whether they like it or not , they do give people a very good impression ."
847,test,work,no_emotion,inform,"But it is unjust to judge a book by its cover . If they ' re not happy or comfortable with their clothes , they can be less productive ."

848,test,relationship,disgust,inform,I thought that all athletes were supposed to be regularly tested for drugs .
848,test,relationship,disgust,inform,They are . The only reason they didn't disqualify him until after the race is because the results from the text only came back afterwards .
848,test,relationship,disgust,inform,That's so disappointing . I don't know why top athletes would feel the need to take drugs .
848,test,relationship,disgust,inform,"I don't think it's right , but I can understand why they might . Imagine how much pressure there would be to win for your country !"
848,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"Regardless of how much pressure you're under , there's never a good reason to take drugs ."

849,test,relationship,no_emotion,question,Sitcoms ?
849,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"Situation comedies . A sitcom is half an hour long and it airs weekly . Sitcom shows tend to be about ordinary people . If there is one thing that all the shows have in common , it is teaching wholesome values ."

850,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,I wish you had been my history teacher ! I might have got better marks !
850,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,Some people say that history repeats itself .
850,test,relationship,no_emotion,question,"What does that mean ? The same events never happen twice , do they ?"
850,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"The idea is that the people and dates change , but the reason why things happen stay the same ."
850,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,I see . I think I ' d agree with that statement . People often seem to make the same mistakes over and over again .

858,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"I mean , I understand that . But the speed of the conversation got faster and faster , until it seemed to me that they would fight . My perception of the tone was that it was a violent shouting match . The truth was that it was a perfectly normal conversation ."
858,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,A shouting match ? You ' re so funny . You must be exaggerating . I don ' t believe it .

908,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"It's hard to be optimistic about things with the way the economy's headed ... The trade deficit is getting larger , consumption's down , I really think we're headed for a recession ."

Factories have outsourced and moved many jobs to foreign countries .

976,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"She started arguing back to my dad that how much she loves her boyfriend , how they're in love and it's not hurting anybody , and so on . My dad said she's too young to do this , and that she should move out right away ."
976,test,relationship,no_emotion,question,How long has your sister been with her boyfriend ?
976,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,Three years . They've been dating since freshman year . They're even talking about marriage .
976,test,relationship,surprise,question,Really ? Then I guess living together would be a good idea .
976,test,relationship,no_emotion,question,What do you mean ?
976,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"Well , these days too many people are getting divorced . If they live together , then at least they're finding out if they're really compatible or not ."

978,test,relationship,no_emotion,question,Why do you say that ?
978,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"Whatever things get tough , he gives in ."
979,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,Uh-oh . We don't have a flashlight .
979,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,Don't worry . We'll make it back to the camp site before dark .
979,test,relationship,no_emotion,inform,I sure hope so .
980,test,school_life,no_emotion,question,"Do you speak only English in the class , or does your teacher explain everything to you in Spanish ?"
