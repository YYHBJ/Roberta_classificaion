83,validation,finance,surprise,question,"Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,question,Do you sell direct to shops ?
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,"Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,question,Do you keep a stock of these things ?
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,"In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,"That is , your commission ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,"Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission .
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,"The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,question,"According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ?"
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,directive,"We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,commissive,"We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ..."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,question,Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ?
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,"Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,"Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,directive,"Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,question,"Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ?"
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,directive,"Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,commissive,"All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency ."
83,validation,finance,no_emotion,inform,Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair .

209,validation,tourism,no_emotion,directive,How long does it take to get there ?
209,validation,tourism,no_emotion,inform,"About twelve hours . We currently have tickets available only for first class on the express train . If you ' d like , you can choose a sleeper on the overnight train which is a bit less expensive ."
209,validation,tourism,no_emotion,question,"Yeah , I think that is the best option . Do you serve food on the train ? Twelve hours is such a long time !"
209,validation,tourism,no_emotion,inform,"Yes , of course . There is a dining car towards the front of the train where they serve meals at all times . We do provide complimentary water and coffee for all of our passengers ."
209,validation,tourism,happiness,directive,Great ! I ' ll take it .
209,validation,tourism,no_emotion,directive,Here you are sir . Your train leaves from platform number nine at nine on the dot . Remember to be here at least thirty minutes before your scheduled departure time or else you might miss your train !

210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,I would like to take a trip to the beach this weekend .
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,question,A trip to the beach would be fun . How is the weather going to be ?
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,The forecast says that it will be warm on the weekend .
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,question,So do you think it'll be perfect weather for the beach ?
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,It sounds like it will be .
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,I really hope it doesn't get cold .
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"That would ruin things , I want to go so badly ."
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"The weather in California is unpredictable , so you never know ."
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,That is true . The weather is constantly changing .
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,It would be nice if the weather would never change .
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"That would be great , then we could plan things sooner ."
210,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,True . Predictable weather would make life easier .
211,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,"Some companies use to ban dating among employees , but now they have realized it is something in avertable . People spend so much time at work . It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other ."
211,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,"If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company ."
211,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,"Beneficial ? I don ' t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating ."
211,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,"But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency ."
211,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,I doubt that .
212,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,Do you eat a lot of healthy food ?
212,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Compared with healthy food , unhealthy food just tastes so much better . And anyway , I believe if you live a low stress Life and are active , you can get away with eating whatever you like . It's all in the mind ."
212,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"You have the point . I think cancer is caused by more worry than by the things we consume . Some good things you should try are cranberry juice , wild rice and yoghurt ."
212,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,What's special about these things ?
212,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Cranberry juice is very good for destroying harmful bacteria in your guts because it's very acidic . Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic . People have been making yoghurt for thousands of years and if you have it every day , your guts will be much more settled ."
212,validation,ordinary_life,happiness,inform,Thanks . I'm going to follow your advice and pop down to the supermarket right now .
213,validation,work,sadness,inform,"I've been so tired recently . I've been trying , but I don't think I'm up to this job ."

213,validation,work,sadness,inform,"Oh , yes , indeed . I've run out of steam . To be honest , I want to be in a different environment ."
213,validation,work,surprise,question,Is that so ?
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,"Yes , I don't want to be stuck in a rut . I want to move on ."
213,validation,work,no_emotion,question,Have you decided ?
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,Yes . I want to get a better job .
213,validation,work,no_emotion,question,Could you tell me why you want to quit ?
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,I quit just because of the dissatisfying salary and the trouble in getting along with my colleagues .
213,validation,work,no_emotion,question,"Oh , that's terrible . Do you want to get a higher salary in our company ?"
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,I'm afraid not . I've promised my girlfriend . We'll travel southwards to find a job that offers higher pay .
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,"OK , I'd like to say that I've really enjoyed working with you . However , I think you should work harder for your new job and then you can ask for higher pay ."
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,Thank you so much for your advice .
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,And every best wish for your new job .
213,validation,work,no_emotion,inform,Thank you .

215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,Let's take the bus .
215,validation,ordinary_life,anger,inform,"I hate the bus system in London ! The bus drivers are rude , the buses are never on time , and there are few people around who can help you ."
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,It's not that bad . You probably just had a bad experience once .
215,validation,ordinary_life,anger,inform,"It wasn't just once . Every single time I take the bus , something bad happens to me or to someone else on the bus ."
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"We could take the subway , but we'd have to go three stops along one line and then change trains twice ."
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Train fares are twice as expensive as the bus fare , too ."
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,"If we don't hurry up , we'll miss the show . Should we take the bus ?"
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,commissive,"We're already late , so I think we had better take a taxi ."
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,I don't think we'll be able to find a taxi very easily during hush hours . Let's just take the bus .
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,commissive,Fine . Have a look at the timetable to find out when the next one arrives .
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,It looks like it should be here in just a few minutes . don't worry . Nothing bad will happen . I'll even buy your ticket for you .
215,validation,ordinary_life,happiness,commissive,"Thanks , that was nice of you ."
215,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"See , now something good has happened to you on a bus trip !"
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,directive,Let's go over this plan again .
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,inform,"From Vancouver , we bike along the border all the way to Winnipeg ."
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,question,"And that is mostly flat , right ?"
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,inform,"Relatively , once we're out of Alberta , anyway . Then it's hills again in Aitoba ."
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,question,"And from Winnipeg we go around the lakes through Toronto , right ?"
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,inform,That's right . And up in to Quebec . And that's where we stop .
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,inform,"It doesn't sound like that much when we go over the plan but that's a long , long ride ."
216,validation,tourism,no_emotion,directive,Are you ready for the cross country of a lifetime ?
217,validation,tourism,no_emotion,question,"Good morning , sir . What can I do for you ?"
217,validation,tourism,anger,directive,I'm Bill . I'm in Room 908 . Can you change the room for me ? It's too noisy . My wife was woken up several times by the noise the baggage elevator made . She said it was too much for her .
217,validation,tourism,no_emotion,commissive,"I'm awfully sorry , sir . I do apologize . Room 908 is at the end of the corridor . It's possible that the noise is heard early in the morning when all is quiet ."
217,validation,tourism,no_emotion,directive,"Anyhow , I'd like to change our room ."
217,validation,tourism,no_emotion,directive,"No problem , sir . We'll manage it , but we don't have any spare room today . Could you wait till tomorrow ? The American People-to-people Education Delegation will be leaving tomorrow morning . There'll be some rooms for you to choose from ."

218,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,"That's beside the point , you still need to go to bed ."

293,validation,finance,no_emotion,commissive,"Why , your price has soared . It ' s almost 25 % higher than last year ' s . It would be impossible for us to push any sales at such a price ."
293,validation,finance,no_emotion,directive,I ' m a little surprised to hear you say that . You know very well that markets for bristles have gone up a great deal in recent months . The price we offer compares favorably with quotations you can get elsewhere .
293,validation,finance,no_emotion,commissive,I ' m afraid I can ' t agree with you there . I must point out your price is higher than some of the quotations we ' Ve received from other sources .
293,validation,finance,no_emotion,directive,But you must take the quality into consideration . Everyone in the trade knows that US ' s bristles are of superior quality to those from other countries .
293,validation,finance,no_emotion,commissive,"I agree that yours are of better quality . But there ' s competition from synthetic products , too . You can ' t very well ignore that . Prices for synthetic bristles haven ' t changed much over the years ."
293,validation,finance,no_emotion,directive,"There ' s practically no substitute for bristles for certain uses . That ' s why demand for natural bristles keeps rising in spite of cheaper synthetic ones . To be frank with you , if it were not for the long - standing relationship between us , we would hardly be willing to make you a firm offer at this price ."
293,validation,finance,no_emotion,commissive,"Well , we ' ll have a lot of difficulties in persuading our clients to buy at this price . But I ' ll have to try , I suppose ."

352,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,I think they're trying to scare the young people so that they don't ever start smoking .
352,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,all advertisers like to catch young people because they know the meaning of loyalty .
352,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"perhaps you're right , , though . Maybe the advertisement would be more effective with adults anyhow ."
352,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"I have nothing against them putting the advertisements in magazines and newspapers that are read by adults , but I don't think they should have their ad on billboards where children can see them ."
352,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,that's a good point . I think I was so delighted to see that a billboard was being used to promote health that I didn't think about how children might understand the ad .
352,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"you have to give them credit , though . It's about time people started becoming more aware of the dangers of smoking ."

438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,commissive,"I don't think it can be avoided , to be honest ."
438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,perhaps it would be better if you started taking public transport system to work .

438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,I know . I feel bad about how much my car is adding to the pollution problem in this city .
438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,Taking the subway would be a lot less stressful than driving as well .
438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,The only problem is that I'm going to really miss having the freedom that you have with a car .
438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Well , when it's nicer outside , you can start biking to work . That will give you just as much freedom as your car usually provides ."
438,validation,ordinary_life,happiness,inform,That's true . I could certainly use the exercise !
438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,"So , are you going to quit driving to work then ?"
438,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Yes , it's not good for me or for the environment ."
439,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,"That's really convenient . We were wondering if you could take a little off the rent , though ."
439,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,commissive,I can take two thousand off . That'll make the rent twenty-eight thousand .
439,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,That's great . Every little bit counts . And we don't need the parking space . I guess we could rent it out .
439,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Sure , for at least three thousand per month ."
439,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,That'll bring the price down to twenty-five . That's the price we were shooting for .
439,validation,ordinary_life,happiness,inform,"I'm glad . Now , there's a deposit fee of two month's rent ."
440,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,Hello . I sent out my laundry yesterday . Aren ' t they ready ?

446,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"as much as I love this city , I think I'm going to have to find a greener city to live in . Living in a polluted city like this just can't be good for my health ."
446,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"I know what you mean . However , there are so few places left that have not been affected by global warming . If it's not the pollution , then it's the natural disasters , deforestation , or the greenhouse"
446,validation,relationship,no_emotion,question,what is the greenhouse effect exactly ?
446,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,it's the gradual rise in the earth's temperature .
446,validation,relationship,no_emotion,question,"I see , so it's similar to global warming ?"

582,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,"Now darling , I know that we've bought this house together , but it's just going to be far too expensive to decorate it . I think we should sell it ."
582,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,commissive,"Oh , no , Nathan , I ... I really think we've bought this flat at the right time , you know . Market prices are going to go up , and I think you'll find in a year or two it will be worth a lot more ."
582,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,directive,But we're going to spend so much money in furnishing and decorating . I think we could get a much cheaper place that's already furnished .

582,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,commissive,"Well , only you liked it really , darling ."

583,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"It's an Egyptian carpet . The student came to my office the other day and brought the carpet to show his gratitude . Seeing what gift was , I was really uncomfortable . I mean it's too expensive a gift for a student to give a professor . I don't think I've done anything to deserve that gift , so I refused it ."
583,validation,ordinary_life,surprise,question,You refused the gift ? That's terrible .
583,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"I know , but I really can't accept such an expensive gift . I explained to him why , but he seemed really upset about it . I think he might have taken it the wrong way ."
583,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,Perhaps . He probably thinks you considered the gift a bribe for a higher grade .
583,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,That's what I am worried about . I do understand the respect attached with the gift and I am honored . But I really don't think it's proper for a student to spend a fortune on a gift for a professor . I think we need to have a talk to make sure we are on the same page .

637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,anger,inform,It's a brick ! I can't believe how stupid I was . Damn it !
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,question,What is it ? Why did you buy a brick ?
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,"There was a guy on the sidewalk . He had three new boxes , Panasonic video camera boxes . He said he had to get rid of them quick ."
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,question,And ?
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,So he said he'd sell me one for twenty dollars . A four-hundred-dollar camera for twenty bucks .
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,question,And it's a brick ?
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,Yes .
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,question,I can't believe how stupid you are . Why didn't you open the box ?
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,"I wanted to . But he said , no , the box is still in its plastic wrap from the store . If it's opened , other people won't believe it's new ."
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,So he had the boxes wrapped in plastic .
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,"Yes , it was the kind of perfect plastic wrap that comes with new products . Look , it even had a bar-code price sticker on it ! It looked brand new ."
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,question,But why would a guy be selling new video cameras for twenty dollars ?
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,He said he had to get rid of them . They were stolen .
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,"Aha ! Now I understand . You were trying to buy stolen goods on the sidewalk . So , what I think is , you deserve to get cheated !"
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,"C'mon , don't blame me ! I thought it was a new camera . We could use it . We were even thinking about buying a camera . I don't understand how he could have such a perfect-looking box ."
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,inform,That's no problem . He just has a friend who works in a shop that can do plastic wrap . That's easy . And probably it's the same shop he got the boxes from . Maybe his friend works in an electronics store . They sell video cameras there . Probably they had a couple video camera boxes lying around . So they get the idea of wrapping bricks to sell to fools like you . Twenty dollars a brick . That's a good profit if they can sell enough bricks .
637,validation,attitude_and_emotion,no_emotion,question,"You're right , Sarah . I was a fool . I can't believe it . How could I fall for such a trick ?"
638,validation,health,no_emotion,question,"Hello , Arthur . What seems to be the problem ?"

638,validation,health,sadness,inform,"Yeah , I know , my vision is really blurry at times ."
638,validation,health,no_emotion,directive,"Ok then , head on over to the other room and pick out some frames while I fill out your prescription ."
638,validation,health,no_emotion,commissive,Thanks doc !
638,validation,health,no_emotion,directive,"Arthur , that ' s the bathroom ."
639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,directive,Would you like some more coffee ?

639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,directive,Good . I'll just stay here until you get back .
639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,commissive,So the total is $ 36 . 00 for our dinner .
639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,question,How much of a tip do you think our waitress deserves ?
639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,I wonder if no tip would be appropriate in light of the service .
639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,inform,"I kind of feel the same way , but they may have just been really short-staffed tonight ."
639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,directive,I think that we should leave 10 % .
639,validation,relationship,no_emotion,commissive,$ 3 . 60 will be the right amount for the tip .

642,validation,health,no_emotion,directive,"Yes . I wonder if you could do something to help me recover soon , because I'll be on a business trip in two days ."
642,validation,health,no_emotion,directive,"Well , you have to let your flu run its course . You must stop working and stay in bed to get plenty of rest . Usually it will take 4 to 6 days to make a full recovery ."
642,validation,health,surprise,commissive,But I'm going on a business trip in two days !
642,validation,health,no_emotion,directive,"Maybe you'll have to cancel it or postpone it . If you go out while you are sick , it won't help you recover . You may even pass your disease on to others ."

869,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,commissive,"Not necessarily . If we use a realtor to find a house , it will be more expensive ."
869,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,What do you mean ?

869,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,question,And doesn't the person selling the house have a realtor ?
869,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Sometimes they do , sometimes they don't . It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves ."
869,validation,ordinary_life,surprise,question,Why ?
869,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,"Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher . He will have to pay a commission to the realtor ."
869,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,Hmm . It all sounds very complicated .
869,validation,ordinary_life,no_emotion,inform,It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time . That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome .
